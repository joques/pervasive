# Pervasive 

Pervasive is a simple prototype of a distributed and asynchronous resource dispatcher. The typical scenario is as follows. A user submits a
resource to Pervasive indicating the topics that resource is related to as well as the name of the file, where the content of the resource is
stored. Pervasive then identifies the devices, which might be interested in displaying the resource.<br/>

Pervasive is implemented in Node.js

# Node.js Installation
<pre><code>
Go to http://nodejs.org/ for more information about Node.js and its installation.
</code></pre>
### Quick tip
<pre><code>
If you are on Mac OS X and using homebrew as your package manager, [sudo] brew install node should do. You
should also install npm, the node.js package manager.
</code></pre>

# App Usage
To use our small app, first start the web server <code node ad_server>

At this point, you have two choices:
1. Either use a TCP connection between the devices and Pervasive
2. Or use WebSockets

<pre><code>
Then start the clients that will eventually receive the resources. As an example we open an nc connection
as follows nc localhost prt_number (see the code for the right port numbers)

Finally open a Web connection as follows:
curl -d "topic=val&topic=val&file_name=myres" localhost:8080 (the web server is running on port 8080)

the resource in the file myres will be sent to the clients you created earlier if they registered for the
right topic
</code></pre>
